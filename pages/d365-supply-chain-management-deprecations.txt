### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios


Reason for deprecation/removal
To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization.

As of that date, Microsoft stopped all active development on manufacturing scenarios for the built-in planning engine, stopped releasing new features, and only released critical bug fixes.  Since that date, all companies that require support for manufacturing scenarios have been required to use Planning Optimization for their master planning calculations. For more information, see Deprecated master planning overview.Since April 2022, only companies with on-premises deployments of Supply Chain Management have been able to continue using the built-in master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios. However, as of March 2023, Microsoft has now fully discontinued all support for the built-in master planning engine for all types of deployments. Hereafter, Microsoft will only provide support for critical blocking issues (which result in no planned orders being created or the continuous failure of built-in master planning). The built-in master planning engine is now referred to as the deprecated master planning engine.
